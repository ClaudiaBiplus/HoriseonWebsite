## Features

To ensure the website meets accessibility standards, the following improvements have been made:

1. **Semantic HTML Elements**: The source code includes semantic HTML elements for better structure and readability.
2. **Logical HTML Structure**: HTML elements are structured logically, independent of styling and positioning.
3. **Accessible Alt Attributes**: All images and icon elements have accessible alt attributes for better screen reader compatibility.
4. **Sequential Heading Attributes**: Heading elements (H1, H2, H3, etc.) are used in a sequential and hierarchical order.
5. **Descriptive Title Elements**: The title elements of each page are concise and descriptive, enhancing search engine visibility.

## Additional Improvements

In line with the Scout Rule, additional improvements were made:

- **Link Functionality**: All hyperlinks were tested and verified for proper functionality.
- **CSS Optimization**: The CSS has been reworked for efficiency by:
    - Consolidating CSS selectors and properties.
    - Organizing CSS to reflect the semantic structure of HTML elements.
    - Adding comments for clarity in each section of the CSS file.
